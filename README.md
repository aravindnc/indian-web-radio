Web radio for India.

## GitHub Pages Setup

To fix the deployment issue, GitHub Pages needs to be properly configured:

1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/aravindnc/indian-web-radio/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the settings
4. The next push to the main branch should trigger a successful deployment

## Deployment Status

The repository is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch. Once Pages is enabled, the site will be available at: https://aravindnc.github.io/indian-web-radio/
